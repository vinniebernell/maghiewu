So I'm trying to install gparted to my computer and am quite confused by the process. I went to gparted.org and downloaded gparted-live-0.28.1-1-amd64.iso. Now I have it as a mounted disk on my computer. I open it up and go to utils/win64 and then I have the exe file and the bat. The exe seems to do nothing and the bat creates a prompt and recommends booting this from a USB and warning me all kinds of things. What am I doing wrong and how do I just get this partition manager onto my computer. –°–±–æ—Ä–∫–∏ Windows IDimm Edition –∏ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã  UltraISO - —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–µ—Ç, –∫–æ–Ω–≤–µ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç, —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç (–¥–æ–±–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å, —É–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å, –∏–∑–≤–ª–µ—á—å —Ñ–∞–π–ª—ã), –∏, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–æ –¥–ª—è –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º —Ç–∞–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞ ‚Äî –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—ã –Ω–∞ CD/DVD.

So I have an SD card that was used in an rpie and it got corrupt and I'm trying to recover it to use it in another device. The SD card has no bad blocks, I've done a read write test over the drive and everything seems to be working fine.

As the title says, I was trying to increase my primary linux partition using left free space. I was live-booting from a usb stick with Ubuntu 16.04 flashed on it. During the move, I clicked on system settings to change the screen off time and the entire laptop froze. I left it in that state for about 4-ish hours to see if it would finish. Spoiler, it did not. Now, I cannot boot into my Ubuntu or anything. However, I took a picture of the gparted window which showed the number of blocks copied.

So for various reasons I had to install ubuntu 16 and 14 on my computer. This was before I really knew too much about how linux works and since then I wanted to reinstall ubuntu 16 over the old version for a clean start. I did so, copying over the old version, but now a program that I used to use says that my computer doesn't meet the required specs. Since it worked before I'm assuming that it was a memory allocation error on my part when reinstalling. I'm using Gparted Download Latest Version of GParted for Free! Works with all Windows(10,7,8/8.1,Vista) versions. so i was using a mac vm to try to get a bootable sierra installer and after about 4 or 5 tries the USB stick has become read only. when it first got stuck into read only it had a uefi, fat32 partition and about 100mb of unallocated space. i was somehow able to format it into ntfs but it still has 100mb of unallocated space. I've tried dd in Linux, diskpart, gparted, windows format and mini-tool partition editor. I've even tried the alcormp tools but i've only gotten 1 to recognize the stick.

I'm looking to make my system dual boot, because I have come to dislike windows 10. One of my concerns is how much space should I allocate for Manjaro's system files and how much space would I need for saving files and downloading programs. Other thing I was wondering is if it is possible to make it so that when I delete a file in windows disk D that space would become available in Manjaro. If i fuck up or later on want to change the partitions of Linux is it possible without reinstalling Manjar.

I didnt make them so know I need to boot my Windows somehow without grub, which is deleted

I ran `hfsck -fy /dev/sda2` (from the hfsutils archlinux package) and it set some HFS specific values (original HFS spec) on my HFSplus volume. Obviously, I didn't know what I was doing and I shouldn't have used `hfsck` at all , let alone with `-fy`, but I'm nearly certain it can be easily recovered by resetting the values properly for an HFSplus volume.
