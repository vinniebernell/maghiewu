                            <p> Lately I've gotten into some of Dworkin's stuff and I have to say she's brilliant and so well spoken. I've also realized she's described as 'problematic' and 'angry' and attacked a lot even by women and I wanted to get some insight - “The price of clinging to the enemy a man is your life. To enter into a relationship with a man who has divested himself as completely and publicly from the male role as much as possible would still be a risk. But to relate to a man who has done any less is suicide. . . . I, personally, have taken the position that I will not appear with any man publicly, where it could possibly be interpreted that we were friends.” – Ti-Grace Atkinson Ti-Grace Atkinson, Amazon Odyssey, Links Books I read this wonderful article about Kate Millet, written by Andrea Dworkin Andrea Dworkin on Kate Millett: Sexual Politics ( I also saw this one posted: What Kate Did (https://newrepublic.com/article/131897/kate). "On the Left, the sexually liberated woman is the woman of pornography. Free male sexuality wants, has a right to, produces, and consumes pornography because pornography is pleasure. Leftist sensibility promotes and protects pornography because pornography is freedom. The pornography glut is bread and roses for the masses. Freedom is the mass-marketing of woman as women. Free sexuality for the woman is in being massively consumed, denied an individual nature, denied any sexual sensibility other.

I remember reading the various obits, all quoting her as a fat, ugly, man hating feminist of the worst kind. Even other feminists were holding her as an example of the kind of feminist that sets us back, someone who hated sex and was willing to capitulate to right wingers to get rid of porn. Now, it's not like I disagreed with her. Porn had consistently ruined After the delightful opinion piece published in today's NYT, I thought we all might enjoy reading Dworkin's scathing, accurate (sometimes quite funny) letter (https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/books/l-reviewing-andrea-dworkin-002887.html) to the NYT. Unfortunate that their attitude towards real feminism remains as misogynistic and intellectually dishonest as ever. Here is her letter, published in 1987: > To the Editor: > >I despair of being treated with respect, let alone. If you don't like the bad and baseless generalizations about men that you can see in r/TwoXChromosomes or in some other feminists forums and subreddits. Then don't generalize about women yourself. If you don't like how men are labeled as violent brutes and rapists, then don't label women as lying and manipulative harpies yourself. If you don't like how some feminists and some women distrust all men cause they were raped or abused or are afraid to be raped, abused or killed. Then don't distrust. Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946 – April 9, 2005) was an American radical feminist and writer best known for her criticism of pornography, which she argued.
