I'm running Windows 10 Insider Build 10565 x64 on a machine with an AMD Phenom 8750 Triple-Core Processor @ 2.4 GHz and 4 GB RAM.

I got a Creative Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS, on my Windows 7 64bit PC. When I listen to music or play my music via a guitar software, everything is perfect.

I went to creative's website and downloaded the latest drivers and installed them (this was last night).
